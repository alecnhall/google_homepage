My attempt at a google clone!

So my first attempt at the google clone found me building the website in an order that seemed to make it more difficult and confusing than it needed to be.

I started my second time around by building from the top down.

Starting with the navbar at the top.

I used w3 schools to help me with my navbar at the top.

- I created a div to house the links that I wanted at the top.
- The top has two <a> tags that house the apps logo and the import option. the middle text is a span.
- Each element has a different class that styles it similarly to the home page.
- I took away the text decoration on all links and change the color of the import option.
- The top bar also has a bottom border on it

The next div house the options on the right of the screen

- All of the inner elements are anchor tags
- Some of them have the same class as options in the div above

- I had a hard time centering the text input but also found it on w3 schools
